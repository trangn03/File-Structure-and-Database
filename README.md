# File Structures and Database Project
The project uses MySQL database and PHP to build a university database application

# Project Descriptions
1. The database keeps information of each professor, including social security number, name, address, telephone number, sex, title, salary and college degrees. The address includes street address, city, state, and zip code. The telephone number includes the area code and 7 digit number
2. Each department has a unique number, name, telephone, office location, and a chair person who is a professor
3. Each course has a unique number, title, textbook, units. Each course also has a set of prerequisite courses. Each course is offered by a department
4. Each course may have several sections. Each section has a section number that is unique within the course, a classroom, a number of seats, meeting days, a beginning time, and ending time. Each section is taught by a professor.
5. The database keeps student records, including campus wide ID, name, address, and telephone number. Each student majors in one department and may minor in several departments. The name includes first name and last name.
6. The database keeps enrollment records. Each record has a student, a course section, and a grade.

    **For the professors:**

    a. Given the social security number of a professor, list the titles, classrooms, meeting days and time of his/her classes

    b. Given a course number and a section number, count how many students get each distinct grade, i.e 'A', 'A-', 'B+', 'B', 'B-', etc

    **For the students:**
    
    a. Given a course number list the sections of a course, including the classroom, the meeting days and time, and the number of students enrolled in each section
    
    b. Given the campus wide ID of a student, list all courses the student took and the grades
